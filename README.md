# MATH 190, Section 01 - History Of Mathematics - Fall 2023 - 3 units

This one semester course is a study of the historical development of
mathematical ideas and techniques through the advent of calculus and their
impact on the general course of the history of western civilization. Part of
the goal of the course is that students develop some understanding
(and even appreciation) of the role of mathematics in different cultures,
of the mathematics as it was done in those societies; and of how our view of
mathematics today has developed. As part of this course, students develop an
understanding of the contributions to mathematics by men and women of
different cultures.

As part of the course, students write a paper on a topic
approved by the instructor.

Throughout the course, students work with the mathematics as it was done at
the time, and develop an ability to reason inductively and formulate and prove
general statements. They study approcahes used by various societies to real
problems, and they develop an appreciation of the connections among the areas
of math from an historical perspective.
